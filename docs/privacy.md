# Privacy Policy

## Summary
All data is processed entirely on Google’s servers, within the Google Apps Scripts platform. Email data is stored in Gmail directly, and only accessed within the Google Apps Script system when showing your email times. This is private to your Google account, and ExactTimes (and its developers) have absolutely no access to this, so your data stays private (in line with your Google account’s data retention policy).

## Plain english

The data which is used by ExactTimes is listed, and described below.
* Gmail addon - ExactTimes is an add-on which can be used in the sidebar of your Gmail interface. It only accesses the message contents of the currently open email thread.
* Gmail read current thread - ExactTimes requires access to your currently open email thread so it can check the exact time of each message in this thread.

## Technical details

The scopes which are required by ExactTimes are listed, and described below.
* [https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.addons.execute](https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.addons.execute) - This allows the ExactTimes add-on to run in the sidebar of Gmail.
* [https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.addons.current.message.readonly](https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.addons.current.message.readonly) - This allows the ExactTimes add-on to read the email messages in the current thread so it can show you the exact time they were sent.

## Limited Use disclosure

ExactTimes's use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes), including the Limited Use requirements.
